The implementation of data acquisition was performed using a Key-logger using \textit{pynput} module of in \textit{python3}. During recording session of each audio, the weakness of this module was highlighted because many keys were not correctly recognized. During acquisition phase, I also notice that some key recognitions depend on the Operating System on which they are performed.\\
The neural network method has limitations: it is reserved to systems on which keras module can be installed. The minimum requirement is to have
