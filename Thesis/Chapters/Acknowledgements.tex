\chaptermark{Acknowledgments}
I would like to express my great appreciation to Professor Migliardi for the availability every time I need some help and to accept me to be my supervisor. I learnt so much thanks to his tips due to his big experience in the software development and security threat. Thanks to our conversations I fell in love with every aspect of my work. I tried to go in deep on every concept he mentioned because of the curiosity he leaves me every time we talk about cyber security.\\\\
I would like to express my great appreciation to Professor Nanni for the hints he gives me during the development of the application.\\\\
I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Guerar to introduce me in the world of the CAPTCHAs and for her availability every time I need. I learnt very much from her works about cyber security.\\\\
I would like to express my great appreciation to the University of Padova for the study path I follow. The uncertainty about the future and the idea of being far from needed cyber security skills have become a stimulus to improve myself. I learn a lot and I got hooked on the programming, starting from zero level of it, thanks to the professors' professionalism and knowledge. During the last five years, I've changed my self and now I spend a lot of my free time programming. Thanks to the University because professors follow my thirst of knowledge and I grew up during the last five years.\\\\
I would like to express my gratitude to my family that taught me to never give up. In particular thanks to my sister that, with her great experience in University course, has been a reference for my study attitude and perseverance.\\\\
Thanks to Cristina, to taught that no goals can be reached without someone, near to you, that believes in you and makes you happy.\\\\
Thanks to Francesca, because even if we had many commitments we have always found 5 minutes to stay together and to support the other one in his/her choices.\\\\
Thanks to Davide to help me improving my IT skills, with new stimulating ideas, and to be near me when I needed it.\\\\
Thanks to everyone that has stayed near to me and that I meet during these years. Everyone left me something and helped me to delete every worry and to have fun outside the study hours.\\\\
