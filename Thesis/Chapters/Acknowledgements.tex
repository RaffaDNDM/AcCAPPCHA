Professor Migliardi\\\\
I would like to express my very great appreciation to Dr Guerar\\\\
I would like to express my gratitude to University of Padova for the study path I performed. The uncertainty about the future and the idea of being far from needed cyber security skills have become a stimulus to improve myself. I learn a lot and I got hooked on the programming, starting from zero level of it, thanks to the professors' professionalism and knowledge. During the last five years, I've changed and now I spend programming all my free time. Thanks to University because professors follow my thirst of knowledge and I grew up, living alone and really becoming an adult.\\\\
Thanks to staff,\\\\
