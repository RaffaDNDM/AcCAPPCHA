      <h2>Summary</h2>
      <div style="text-align: right; float: right;"><img alt="eavesdrop on computer" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/nobody-listens3.jpg" style="width: 366px; height: 143px; margin-left: 1.5em;"><br>
      </div>
      Many computers emit a high-pitched noise during operation, due to
      vibration in some of their electronic components. These acoustic
      emanations are more than a nuisance: they can convey information about the
      software running on the computer and, in particular, leak sensitive
      information about security-related computations. In a <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/ec04rump/">preliminary
        presentation</a>, we have shown that different RSA keys induce different
      sound patterns, but it was not clear how to extract individual key bits.
      The main problem was the very low bandwidth of the acoustic side channel
      (under 20 kHz using common microphones, and a few hundred kHz using
      ultrasound microphones), many orders of magnitude below the GHz-scale
      clock rates of the attacked computers.<br>
      <br>
      Here, we describe a new <em>acoustic cryptanalysis</em> key extraction
      attack, applicable to GnuPG's current implementation of RSA. The attack
      can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of
      various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer
      during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts. We experimentally
      demonstrate that such attacks can be carried out, using either a plain
      mobile phone placed next to the computer, or a more sensitive microphone
      placed 4 meters away.<br>
      <br>
      Beyond acoustics, we demonstrate that a similar low-bandwidth attack can
      be performed by measuring the electric potential of a computer chassis. A
      suitably-equipped attacker need merely touch the target computer with his
      bare hand, or get the required leakage information from the ground wires
      at the remote end of VGA, USB or Ethernet cables.<br>

      <h2>Q&amp;A<br>
      </h2>
      <h3> Q1: What information is leaked?</h3>
      <h3><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></h3>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>This depends on the specific
      computer hardware. We have tested numerous laptops, and several desktops.<br>
      <ul>
        <li>In&nbsp;almost all machines, it is possible to distinguish an idle
          CPU (x86 "HLT") from a busy CPU.</li>
        <li>On many machines, it is moreover possible to distinguish different
          patterns of CPU operations and different programs. </li>
        <li>Using <a href="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</a> as our study case,
          we can, on some machines:
          <ul>
            <li>distinguish between the acoustic signature of different RSA
              secret keys (signing or decryption), and</li>
            <li>fully extract decryption keys, by measuring the sound the
              machine makes during decryption of chosen ciphertexts.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3> Q2: What is making the noise?</h3>
      The acoustic signal of interest is generated by vibration of electronic
      components (capacitors and coils) in the computer's voltage regulation
      circuit, as it struggles to supply constant voltage to the CPU.<br>
      <br>
      When different secret keys are used for decryption, they cause different
      patterns of CPU operations, which draw different amounts of power. The
      voltage regulator changes its behavior to maintain a stable voltage to the
      CPU despite the changes in power draw, and this alters the electric
      currents and voltages inside the voltage regulator itself. Those electric
      fluctuations cause mechanical vibrations in the electronic component, and
      the vibrations are transmitted into the air as sound waves.<br>
      <br>
      The relevant signal is <em>not</em> caused by mechanical components such
      as the fan or hard disk, nor by the laptop's internal speaker. <span style="font-style: italic;"><br>
      </span>
      <h3> <a name="Q-mobile"></a>Q3: Does the attack require special
        equipment?</h3>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>It sure helps, and in the <a href="http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/new.html#paper">paper</a>
      we describe an expensive hardware setup for getting the best sensitivity
      and frequency response. But in some cases, a regular mobile phone is good
      enough. We have used a mobile phone to acoustically extract keys from a
      laptop at a distance of 30cm, as in the following picture.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 455px; height: 245px;" alt="mobile phone attack" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/resized_mobile-attack.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h3> Q4: What is the acoustic attack range?<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>That
      depends on many factors. Using a sensitive parabolic microphone, we
      surpassed 4 meters. In the following example, a parabolic microphone,
      attached to a padded case of equipment (power supply, amplifier, filters,
      and a laptop running the attack code) is extracting an RSA key from a
      target laptop (on the far side of the room).<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 700px; height: 367px;" alt="parabolic mic attack in classroom" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/web_classroom.jpg"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      Without the ungainly parabolic dish, we achieved a range of 1 meter. In
      the following, the target (A) is on the right, and the attacker is on the
      left. Only the capsule of the microphone, marked (B), is sensitive to
      position and orientation; the rest of the attacker's equipment can be
      hidden away.<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 700px; height: 270px;" alt="portable setup" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/web_portable-setup.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <h3> <a name="scenarios"></a>Q5: What are some examples of attack
        scenarios?</h3>
      <h3> </h3>
      <div style="text-align: right; float: right;"><a href="http://www.advprograms.com/pdfs/105_Workstation_Specs.pdf"><img alt="TEMPEST-protected workstation" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/tempest-computer-api-dwt-crop.png" style="width: 148px; height: 293px; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em;"></a><br>
      </div>
      We discuss some prospective attacks in our <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/#paper">paper</a>.
      In a nutshell:<br>
      <ul>
        <li>Install an attack app on your phone. Set up a meeting with the
          victim and place the phone on the desk next to his laptop (see <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/#Q-mobile">Q2</a>).</li>
        <li>Break into the victim's phone, install the attack app, and wait
          until the victim inadvertently places his phone next to the target
          laptop.</li>
        <li>Construct a web page use the microphone of the computer running the
          browser (using Flash or HTML Media Capture, under some excuse such as
          VoIP chat). When the user permits the microphone access, use it to
          steal the user's secret key.</li>
        <li>Put your stash of eavesdropping bugs and laser microphones to a new
          use.</li>
        <li>Send your server to a colocation facility, with a good microphone
          inside the box, and then acoustically extract keys from all nearby
          servers.</li>
        <li>Get near a TEMPEST/1-92 protected machine, such as the <a href="http://www.advprograms.com/pdfs/105_Workstation_Specs.pdf">one</a>
          pictured to the right, place a microphone next to its ventilation
          holes, and extract its supposedly-protected secrets.</li>
      </ul>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span>
      <h3> Q6: What if I don't have any microphone, or the environment is too
        noisy?<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
      Another low-bandwidth channel is the electric potential of the laptop's
      chassis. We've shown that in many computers, this "ground" potential
      fluctuates (even when connected to a grounded power supply) and leaks the
      requisite signal. This can be measured in several ways, including <i>human
        touch</i> and <i>far end of cable</i> attacks, which are detailed in
      our follow-up paper titled "<a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff">Get Your Hands Off My
        Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks On PCs</a>".<br>
      <ul>
      </ul>
      <h3><a name="Q-power"></a>Q7: Can an attacker use power analysis instead?</h3>
      <p>Yes, power analysis (by measuring the current drawn from the laptop's
        DC power supply) is another way to perform our low-bandwidth attack.
        This too is detailed in our follow-up paper, "<a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/handsoff">Get
          Your Hands Off My Laptop: Physical Side-Channel Key-Extraction Attacks
          On PCs</a>".</p>
      <p>If the attacker can measure clockrate-scale (GHz) power leakage, then
        traditional power analysis may also be very effective, and far faster.
        However, this&nbsp;is foiled by the common practice of filtering out
        high frequencies on the power supply.</p>
      <h3><a name="kHz-GHz"></a>Q8: How can low-frequency (kHz) acoustic
        leakage provide useful information about a much faster (GHz)?</h3>
      Individual CPU operations are too fast for a microphone to pick up, but
      long operations (e.g., modular exponentiation in RSA) can create a
      characteristic (and detectable) acoustic spectral signature over many
      milliseconds. In the chosen-ciphertext key extraction attack, we carefully
      craft the inputs to RSA decryption in order to maximize the dependence of
      the spectral signature on the secret key bits. See also <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/#bit-extract">Q18</a>.<br>
      <br>
      For the acoustic channel, we can't just increase the measurement
      bandwidth: the bandwidth of acoustic signals is very low: up to 20 kHz for
      audible signals and commodity microphones, and up to a few hundred kHz
      using ultrasound microphones. Above a few hundred kHz, sound propagation
      in the air has a very short range: essentially, when you try to vibrate
      air molecules so fast they just heat up, instead of moving in unison as a
      sound wave.<br>
      <h3><a name="Q-GnuPG"></a>Q9: How vulnerable is GnuPG now? </h3>
      We have disclosed our attack to GnuPG developers under <a href="http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2013-4576">CVE-2013-4576</a>,
      suggested suitable countermeasures, and worked with the developers to test
      them. New versions of GnuPG 1.x and of libgcrypt (which underlies GnuPG
      2.x), containing these countermeasures and resistant to our current
      key-extraction attack, were released concurrently with the first public
      posting of these results. Some of the effects we found (including RSA key
      distinguishability) remain present. <br>
      <h3> Q10: How vulnerable are other algorithms and cryptographic
        implementations?<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span></h3>
      This is an open research question. Our attack requires careful
      cryptographic analysis of the implementation, which so far has been
      conducted only for the GnuPG 1.x implementation of RSA. Implementations
      using ciphertext blinding (a common side channel countermeasure) appear
      less vulnerable. We have, however, observed that GnuPG's implementation of
      ElGamal encryption also allows acoustically distinguishing keys.<br>
      <h3>Q11: Is there a realistic way to perform a chosen-ciphertext attack on
        GnuPG?</h3>
      <p>To apply the attack to GnuPG, we found a way to cause GnuPG to
        automatically decrypt ciphertexts chosen by the attacker. The idea is to
        use encrypted e-mail messages following the <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4880">OpenPGP</a>
        and <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3516">PGP/MIME</a>
        protocols. For example, <a href="https://www.enigmail.net/">Enigmail</a>
        (a popular plugin to the Thunderbird e-mail client) automatically
        decrypts incoming e-mail (for notification purposes) using GnuPG. An
        attacker can e-mail suitably-crafted messages to the victims, wait until
        they reach the target computer, and observe the acoustic signature of
        their decryption (as shown above), thereby closing the adaptive attack
        loop.</p>
      <h3> Q12: Won't the attack be foiled by loud fan noise, or by
        multitasking, or by several computers in the same room?</h3>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>Usually not. The interesting
      acoustic signals are mostly above 10KHz, whereas typical computer fan
      noise and normal room noise are concentrated at lower frequencies and can
      thus be filtered out. In task-switching systems, different tasks can be
      distinguished by their different acoustic spectral signatures. Using
      multiple cores turns out to help the attack (by shifting down the signal
      frequencies). When several computers are present, they can be told apart
      by spatial localization, or by their different acoustic signatures (which
      vary with the hardware, the component temperatures, and other
      environmental conditions). <br>
      <h3> Q13: What countermeasures are available?</h3>
      <h3><span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></span></h3>
      <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-style: italic;"> </span></span>One
      obvious countermeasure is to use sound dampening equipment, such as
      "sound-proof" boxes, designed to sufficiently attenuate all relevant
      frequencies. Conversely, a sufficiently strong wide-band noise source can
      mask the informative signals, though ergonomic concerns may render this
      unattractive. Careful circuit design and high-quality electronic
      components can probably reduce the emanations. <br>
      <br>
      Alternatively, the cryptographic software can be changed, and algorithmic
      techniques employed to render the emanations less useful to the attacker.
      These techniques ensure that the rough-scale behavior of the algorithm is
      independent of the inputs it receives; they usually carry some performance
      penalty, but are often used in any case to thwart other side-channel
      attacks. This is what we helped implement in GnuPG (see <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/#Q-GnuPG">Q9</a>).
      <h3> Q14: Why software countermeasures? Isn't it the hardware's
        responsibility to avoid physical leakage?</h3>
      <p>It is tempting to enforce proper layering, and decree that preventing
        physical leakage is the responsibility of the physical hardware.
        Unfortunately, such low-level leakage prevention is often impractical
        due to the very bad cost vs. security tradeoff: (1) any leakage remnants
        can often be amplified by suitable manipulation at the higher levels, as
        we indeed do in our chosen-ciphertext attack; (2) low-level mechanisms
        try to protect all computation, even though most of it is insensitive or
        does not induce easily-exploitable leakage; and (3) leakage is often an
        inevitable side effect of essential performance-enhancing mechanisms
        (e.g., consider <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/papers/cache.pdf">cache attacks</a>).<br>
        <br>
        Application-layer, algorithm-specific mitigation, in contrast, prevent
        the (inevitably) leaked signal from bearing any useful information. It
        is often cheap and effective, and most cryptographic software (including
        GnuPG and libgcrypt) already includes various sorts of mitigation, both
        through explicit code and through choice of algorithms. In fact, the
        side-channel resistance of software implementations is nowadays a major
        concern in the choice of cryptographic primitives, and was an explicit
        evaluation criterion in NIST's AES and SHA-3 competitions.</p>
      <h3>Q15: What about other acoustic attacks?</h3>
      <h3><span style="font-style: italic;"></span></h3>
      <span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>See the discussion and
      references in our <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/#paper">paper</a>, and the Wikipedia page on
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acoustic_cryptanalysis">Acoustic
        Cryptanalysis</a>. In a nutshell:<br>
      <br>
      Eavesdropping on keyboard keystrokes has been well discussed; keys can be
      distinguished by timing, or by their different sounds. While this attack
      is applicable to data that is entered manually (e.g., passwords), it is
      not applicable to larger secret data such as RSA keys. Another acoustic
      source is hard disk head seeks; this source does not appear very useful in
      the presence of caching, delayed writes and multitasking. Preceding modern
      computers is MI5's "ENGULF" technique (recounted in Peter Wright's book <span style="font-style: italic;">Spycatcher</span>), whereby a phone tap was
      used to eavesdrop on the operation of an Egyptian embassy's Hagelin cipher
      machine, thereby recovering its secret key.<span style="font-style: italic;">
      </span>Declassified US government publications describe "TEMPEST" acoustic
      leakage from mechanical and electromechanical devices, but do make no
      mention of modern electronic computers. <br>

      <h3> </h3>
      <h3><a name="samples"></a>Q17: What does this acoustic leakage sound
        like?</h3>
      To human ears, the acoustic leakage typically sounds like a faint,
      high-pitched whining or buzzing noise (if it is at all within audible
      range).&nbsp; However, if we could hear ultrasound, it might sound like
      this <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/img/gnupg-manykeys-downshifted.mp3">processed audio
        recording of GnuPG decrypting several ciphertexts [mp3]</a>. (To make it
      audible, we selected the interesting frequencies using a bandpass filter,
      and then downshifted them to within human hearing range.) In this
      recording, we can discern several pairs of tones. Each such pair is the
      sound made by a single RSA decryption. There are two tones per decryption
      because, internally, each GnuPG RSA decryption first exponentiates modulo
      the secret prime <em>p</em> and then modulo the secret prime <em>q</em>
      <em> </em>? and we can actually hear the difference between these stages.
      Moreover, each of these pairs of tones sounds different <em> </em>?
      because each decryption uses a different key. So in this example, by
      simply listening to the processed signal, we can distinguish between
      different secret keys,<br>
      <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
      A better way to understand the signal is to visualize it as a spectrogram,
      which plots the acoustic power as a function of time and frequency. For
      example, here is another recording of GnuPG decrypting several RSA
      ciphertexts:<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 800px; height: 412px;" title="spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions" alt="spectrogram of multiple GnuPG RSA decryptions" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/web_manykeys-acoustic.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      In this spectrogram, the horizontal axis (frequency) spans 40 kHz, and the
      vertical axis (time) spans 1.4 seconds. Each yellow arrow points to the
      middle of a GnuPG RSA decryption. It is easy to see where each decryption
      starts and ends. We also observe that the sound changes halfway through
      each decryption: this is the aforementioned switch from the secret prime <em>p</em>
      to the secret prime <em>q.</em> Most interestingly, we can see the subtle
      differences between these decryptions (especially near the yellow arrows)
      <em> </em>? and thus distinguish between different secret keys.<br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
      <h3><a name="bit-extract"></a>Q18: How do you extract the secret key
        bits?</h3>
      The key extraction attacks finds the secret key bits one by one,
      sequentially. For each bit, the attacker crafts a ciphertext of a special
      form, that makes the acoustic leakage depend specifically on the value of
      that bit<em></em>. The attacker then triggers decryption of that chosen
      ciphertext, records the resulting sound, and analyzes it. The following
      demonstrates a typical stage of this attack, focusing on a single secret
      key bit. If this bit is 0, then decryption of the chosen ciphertext will
      sound like the left-side spectrogram (with a strong component at 35.2
      kHz). If the secret bit is 1, the decryption will sound like the
      right-side spectrogram (where the strong component is at 38.1 kHz).<br>
      <br>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 881px; height: 191px;" title="spectrograms depending on value of a key bit" alt="spectrograms depending on value of a key bit" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/web_bit-extraction.jpg"><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      Using automated signal classification, the attack tells apart these cases,
      and deduces the secret key bit.<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px; display: inline ! important; float: none;"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span><br>
      <br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: &#39;Times New Roman&#39;; font-size: medium; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: justify; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; word-spacing: 0px;">
      <h3><a name="shielding"></a>Q19: Aren't sensitive devices protected by
        shielding?</h3>
      <p>Interestingly, many of the physical side-channel countermeasures used
        in highly sensitive applications, such as air gaps, Faraday cages, and
        power supply filters, provide no protection against acoustic leakage. In
        particular, Faraday cages containing computers require ventilation,
        which is typically provided by means of vents covered with perforated
        sheet metal or metal honeycomb (see <a href="https://www.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/#scenarios">Q1 above</a>).
        These are very effective at attenuating compromising electromagnetic
        radiation (``TEMPEST''), but are nearly transparent to sound.</p>
      <p>For example, the following depicts recording the acoustic emanations
        through a double-honeycomb metal ventilation mesh designed for blocking
        electromagnetic radiation. (Covering this mesh with cardboard eliminates
        the signal.)</p>
      <div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 700px; height: 274px;" alt="microphone measuring a laptop through a mesh ventilation panel" src="./Acoustic cryptanalysis_files/web_mesh-setup.jpg"><br>
        <br>
      </div>
      <h3>Q20: What is the purpose of your research?</h3>
      <p>People entrust their most private information to computers, under the
        assumption that their computers will keep their secrets. Our goal is to
        discover when this assumption is dangerously false: to understand how
        information may be leaking in unexpected ways that can be used
        nefariously. We then seek ways to build software and hardware that will
        better protect the users. In this case, for example, we worked with the
        developers of the vulnerable software to change the mathematical
        operations so that the emitted sound will not reveal the secret key.</p>
      <p>Moreover, at a philosophical level, we are intrigued by the tension
        between <em>computation</em> and <em>computers</em>. Most of computer
        science&nbsp; deals with <em>computation</em>, the abstract
        mathematical manipulation of numbers, with formally-designated inputs
        and outputs. But this computation is eventually embodied in
        physical&nbsp; <em>computers,</em> with myriad unexpected outputs
        (physical leakage) and inputs (via sensors and faults). The abstractions
        underlying computer science and programming, productive as they are,
        blind us to those phenomena. By challenging and excavating through the
        convenient abstractions, we gain a deeper understanding of those
        evanescent ensembles of energy and electrons to which we entrust our
        daily lives.</p>
